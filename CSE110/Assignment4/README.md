# Lab Assignment 4 
**Course:** Programming Language I (CSE110)  
**Author:** MD. Shawon Hossain  
**Language:** Python  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This assignment focuses on **string operations** in Python:

- String `slicing`, `reversing`, and `transformations`
- Checking and manipulating substrings
- ASCII operations with `ord()` and `chr()`
- Pattern generation with loops
- Practical problems with string concatenation, formatting, and case handling

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed  
- Basic understanding of **loops and conditions**  
- Familiarity with **lstring indexing and slicing** in Python

## 📂 Tasks  
The assignment includes **15 core tasks** (+ optional 16–19):

- **Task 1–5** → String reversing, partial reversing, binary check, suffix modification, substring patterns
- **Task 6–10** → ASCII conversions, shifting alphabets, removing even-index characters, duplicate removal, string mixing
- **Task 11–15** → Loop-based tracing tasks with string building and conditions
- **Task 16–19 (Optional)** → Extra practice (removal, splitting, concatenation, alternating case)

---

## 🛠️ How to Run  
Run any task individually from the terminal:  
```bash
python3 src/task1.py
python3 src/task2.py
# ...and so on

## 📎 Notes
- All programs are implemented in **Python 3**
- Input/Output strictly follows the original **Assignment PDF** (`docs/Assignment4.pdf`)
- This repository is organized for **practice, learning, and portfolio showcase**
