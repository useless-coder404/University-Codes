## 📌 Overview  
This assignment focuses on **loops and iterations** in Python:

- Using `while` and `for` loops
- Applying nested loops
- Iterative summations and counters
- Handling number patterns, sequences, and mathematical problems

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed  
- Basic understanding of **variables, operators and conditions**  
- Familiarity with **loop structures (while, for)** in Python

## 📂 Tasks  
The assignment includes **24 core tasks** (+ optional 25–29):  

- **Task 1–5** → Loop sequences, repetition, odd/even printing  
- **Task 6–10** → Mathematical summations & digit operations
- **Task 11–15** → Counting digits, divisors, primes, perfect numbers
- **Task 16–19** → Max/min/average, patterns (square, rectangle, triangle)
- **Task 20–24** → Loop tracing & debugging exercises
- **Task 25–29 (Optional)** → Fibonacci, binary conversion, prime/perfect count in ranges, advanced digit problems

---

## 🛠️ How to Run  
Run any task individually from the terminal:  
- ```bash
python3 src/task1.py
python3 src/task2.py
# ...and so on

---

## 📎 Notes
- All programs are implemented in **Python 3**
- Input/Output strictly follows the original **Assignment PDF** (`docs/Assignment3.pdf`)
- This repository is organized for **practice, learning, and portfolio showcase**
