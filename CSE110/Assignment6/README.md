# Lab Assignment 6 
**Course:** Programming Language I (CSE110)  
**Author:** MD. Shawon Hossain  
**Language:** Python  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This assignment focuses on **Tuples and Dictionaries** in Python:

- Accessing, slicing, and reversing tuples
- Tuple unpacking and element counting
- Dictionary creation, merging, and filtering
- Character frequency, nested values, and key–value transformations
- Real-world inspired problems using tuples and dictionaries

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed  
- Basic understanding of **variables, loops, and conditions**  
- Familiarity with **tuples and dictionaries** in Python  
- Knowledge of **unpacking, membership operators, and dictionary functions** in Python

## 📂 Tasks  

The assignment includes **14 core tasks** (+ optional 15–20):
- **Task 1–6 (Tuples)** → Accessing values, slicing, size & iteration, unpacking, counting, reversing
- **Task 7–14 (Dictionaries)** → Merging, averaging, filtering by value, finding max, frequency count, nested items, grouping by key, debugging code
- **Task 15–20 (Optional)** → Advanced tuple/dictionary problems (tuple multiplication, nested replacements, dictionary cleanup, range-based filtering, grouping by tuple values, ASCII-based hashing of words)

---

## 🛠️ How to Run  
Run any task individually from the terminal:  
```bash
python3 src/task1.py
python3 src/task2.py
# ...and so on
```

## 📎 Notes
- All programs are implemented in **Python 3**
- Input/Output strictly follows the original **Assignment PDF** (`docs/Assignment6.pdf`)
- This repository is organized for **practice, learning, and portfolio showcase**
